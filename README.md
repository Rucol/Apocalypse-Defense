Welcome to Apocalypse Defense, a 2D tower defense game where you defend the last bastion of humanity against incoming mutants.

## About

In this game, players must strategically place defensive towers along a path to prevent waves of mutants from reaching the human stronghold. Each tower has unique abilities and strengths, and players must use their resources wisely to upgrade and optimize their defenses.

### Features

- **Tower Placement:** Strategically place towers along the path to maximize their effectiveness against incoming mutants.
- **Upgrade System:** Upgrade towers to increase their power and unlock new abilities.
- **Variety of Enemies:** Face off against different types of mutant enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
- **Challenging Levels:** Progress through increasingly difficult levels as you defend against larger and more powerful waves of mutants.
- **Pathfinding Mechanics:** Utilize pathfinding algorithms to create dynamic enemy movement and challenging gameplay.
- **Physics:** Implement physics mechanics to create realistic interactions between towers, projectiles, and enemies.

## Development Contributions

As a developer, my contributions to the project included:

- **Scripting:** Developed scripts to handle various game mechanics and functionalities.
- **Map Modeling:** Designed and modeled the game maps, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and strategic gameplay.
- **Game Mechanics:** Implemented core gameplay mechanics, including tower placement, enemy behavior, and wave progression.
- **Physics Integration:** Integrated physics systems to create realistic interactions within the game environment.

### Tower Functionality Scripts

Additionally, I developed scripts responsible for the functionality of defensive towers. These scripts govern tower behavior, including targeting and attacking enemies, upgrading abilities, and managing resources.
